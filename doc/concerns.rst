**Concerns**

I thought about using a wikipedia database dump file which is available here http://dumps.wikimedia.org.
But I came to the conclusion that I do want to work in a direction to work with api data as a dump is not always available. So please see this wikipedia api scraping method as a temporary solution as it is inefficient for our case.
